### Hi there üëã

My name is Owen. I'm a programmer, or at least that's what I do for money.
I also like woodworking and being outside. Food is something I think about a lot.

The kind of programming I like to do generally involves making tools.
Usually it's tools to make my life easier but sometimes it's tools for other people to use. To automate their infrastructure, or their build process or their interactions
with servers, or their buzzword usage (gotta have lots of buzz words).

I started my "career" working in web development and then moved to the games industry which I like better.
Right now I'm living in Vermont where I'm building a homestead to raise goats and sheep on so I can have some one to talk to.
While I'm doing that (it's a slow process) I'm working as a freelance programmer, moving from virtual town to virtual town slingin' code.
And dazzlin' the locals. I do business through my LLC Wabisoft. It's pretty legit ;)

I have experience in the following technologies:
- C++
- Unreal
- Docker
- Conan
- Kubernetes
- Python
- Flask
- C#/.NET

That's probably not everything I've worked with but it's what I can remember.

You can email me at owen@wabisoft.io but only if you have a job or food you'd like to send me.  
https://owenstranathan.com is my website. I spend too much time writing blogs and tinkering with the design so you should hire me so I can stop doing that.  
üßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èA sauna a day keeps the doctor away üßñ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è is a motto I would live by if I had a sauna. You should hire me so I can afford to build one.

Anyway I have no idea how to stop writing this so thanks for stopping by, if you see something you like help yourself. ‚úå
